// ACTIVE_PLATFORM = 'auto' (default): detects the platform at runtime.
//   - On crazygames.com  -> uses CrazyGames SDK
//   - On gamemonetize.com -> uses GameMonetize SDK (if gameId set below)
//   - On gamedistribution.com -> uses GameDistribution SDK (if gameId set below)
//   - Anywhere else (localhost, GitHub Pages, etc.) -> no ads, no errors
//
// You do NOT need to change 'auto' or edit this file to submit to CrazyGames.
// You only edit this file when GameMonetize or GameDistribution give you a
// Game ID after you register and upload there.
